### Set-up
Please refer to the [freightpower-v2](https://github.com/cs620-schneider-freightpower/freightpower-v2) README for the set-up instructions to view the implementation locally.

### Overview
This is our architecture diagram, which provides an overview of the platform:

Each repository has its own README on the specific code/implementation details!

### Next Steps
There are a few ideas that we would continue to work on:
* Developing a web version of this app to fully simulate FreightPower
* Continue to enhance the recommendation engine and explore additional models that could be developed
* Add aditional UI/UX changes to continue making the interface minimal and easy for our target users (like Earl, our user persona!)
